These directories contain sources, scripts, and Dockerfiles for building
the base IBM ewallet demo application containers, and containers for
running these applications in zircon.

The base containers are under the base subdirectory. Some of the containers
have been lightly modified to create base images that are capable of
being turned into zircon applications. nginx requires the most changes,
as nginx currently requires source patches and a special build to
work with zircon. (Zircon bugs ZIRC-284, ZIRC-285).

The zircon subdirectory contains the scripts and Dockerfiles for
building the zircon packages.

There are three containers for the ewallet application:
- mysql, the database
- ewallet, a web application using the Flask framework (written in Python)
- nginx, the web server

base/nginx-base builds a special nginx base image that can run in zircon.
It patches the nginx source to work around ZIRC-284. This is in turn
used by the base/nginx container, which adds the ewallet-specific
configuration for nginx.

The deploy directory contains configuration files for running the base
containers with Kubernetes.
